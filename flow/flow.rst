Overview
++++++++

.. note::

  Estimated time to complete: 30-40 MINUTES

In this exercise you will enable Nutanix Microsegmentation, a feature part of Nutanix Flow which simplifies network and policy management with a focus towards applications – enabling applications and environments to be governed independent of the physical infrastructure.
You will create the VMs to be used throughout this exercise, **if you have not cloned the VMs already as part of the Lab - Deploying Workloads exercise**.

As part of this exercise you will:
- Place a VM into quarantine and observe the behavior of the VM and inspect the configurable options inside the quarantine policy
- Create a custom category with different custom values.
- Create and implement an isolation security policy that uses the newly created category in order to restrict unauthorized access.
- Create an application category named **app-abc**, assign the **AppType: app-abc** category to your application VM, which in this exercise is the **flow-abc-5** VM.
- Create a security policy to restrict the application VM from receiving ICMP ping requests from VMs outside of the **programs-abc: sales-abc** category.

Enabling Microsegmentation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Open https://<Prism-Central-IP>:9440/ in a browser and log in.

From the navigation bar, click the question mark at the top right corner and expand the **New in Prism Central** section of the menu.

Click **Microsegmentation**.

Select the **Enable Microsegmentation** check box within the **Enable Microsegmentation** dialog box.

.. figure:: images/enable_flow.png

.. note::

  Flow can only be enabled once per Prism Central instance. If **Microsegmentation** displays a green check mark next to it, that means Microsegmentation has already been enabled for the Prism Central instance being used.

Click **Enable**

Isolate Environments with Flow
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Create a New Category
.....................

Log on to the Prism Central environment and navigate to **Explore > Categories**.

.. note::
  There should be default categories present. Now you will create a custom category to add to the list as well.

Click **New Category**.

Fill out the following fields and click **Save**:

- **Name** - Programs-abc, replacing abc with your initials.
- **Purpose** - This category will be used to tag VMs belonging to the program called "Programs-abc", as an example. This category will have "intern" and "sales" values in order to differentiate intern and sales VMs within the **programs-abc** category.
- **Values** - interns-abc.
- **Values** - sales-abc.

.. figure:: images/create_category.png

Create a New Security Policy
............................

Navigate to **Explore > Security Policies** within Prism Central.

Click **Create Security Policy** > Select **Isolate Environments**.

Fill out the following fields and click **Apply Now**:

- **Name** - isolate-interns-sales-abc, replacing abc with your initials.
- **Purpose** - Isolate intern vm traffic from sales.
- **Isolate This Category** - programs-abc:interns-abc.
- **From This Category** - programs-abc:sales-abc.
Do NOT select the check box for **Apply the isolation only within a subset of the data center**.

•	Enter interns-abc as a possible value of this category, replacing abc with your initials.
•	Click the plus sign and enter sales-abc as another value in this category, replacing abc with your initials.

.. note::
  The Save and Monitor button allows you to save the configuration and monitor how the security policy works without applying it.

Apply the New Security Policy
.............................

Confirm communication is possible before applying the categories to the VMs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Navigate to **Explore > VMs**.

Open the VM console of **flow-abc-3** and **flow-abc-4** by selecting one VM at a time then clicking on the checkbox next to it.

Click **Actions > Launch Console**.

Log into both VMs and find the ips of the VMs via the command *ifconfig*. Ping from the **flow-abc-3** VM to the **flow-abc-4** VM.

.. note::
  The pings should succeed because these two VMs do not yet have categories assigned.

Assign a category to the VMs flow-abc-3 and flow-abc-4
-------------------------------------------------------
Navigate to **Explore > VMs**.

Select **flow-abc-3** and click **Actions > Manage Categories**.

In the Set Categories text box on the left side of the UI, type intern and select **programs-abc:interns-abc** from autocomplete. Click Save.

Select **flow-abc-4** and click **Actions > Manage Categories**.

In the Set Categories text box on the left side of the UI, type sales and select **Actions > Manage Categories** programs-abc:sales-abc from autocomplete. Click Save.

Confirm communication is NOT possible after applying the categories to the VMs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open the VM console of **flow-abc-3** and **flow-abc-4**.

Log into both VMs and ping from the **flow-abc-3** VM to the **flow-abc-4** VM.

.. note::
  The pings should NOT succeed because these two VMs now belong to the programs-abc:intern-abc and programs-abc:sales-abc categories and the policy isolate-interns-sales-abc, which was created earlier, isolates these two types of VMs.

Is this traffic blocked?

Takeaways
+++++++++

- Microsegmentation is a decentralized security framework included from within Prism Central.
- It offers additional protection against malicious threats that originate from within the data center and spread laterally, from one machine to another.
- Once Microsegmentation is enabled in the cluster, VMs can be easily protected through Security Policies as created in the Prism Central UI. These function as labels that can easily be applied to VMs without any additional network setup.
- In this exercise you utilized Flow to quarantine a VM in the environment using the two modalities of the quarantine policy, which are strict and forensic.
- The forensic modality is key in allowing you to study the connection patterns into and out of a VM in order to establish which connections are allowed or denied while the VM is quarantined.
- In this exercise you also created categories and an isolation security policy with ease without having to alter or change any networking configuration.
- After tagging the VMs with the categories created, the VMs simply behaved according to the policies they belong to.
- You also created a category to protect a special application VM. Then you created the security policy to restrict ICMP traffic into that application VM.
- Notice that the policy created is in **Save and Monitor** mode, which means traffic is not actually going to get blocked yet until the policy is applied. This is helpful in order to study the connections and ensure no true traffic is getting blocked unintentionally.
- Flow visualization allows you to visualize the flows that are occurring within a policy. From there it's really easy to edit the policy in order to add or remove the flows that should or should not be occurring.
